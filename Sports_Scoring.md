## Sports Scoring app

Build an app that lets a sports fan keep track of their favourite sports league.

As a huge fan of [your sport], you want to stay up to date with the league. You're interested to see which team leads the table and who won the latest games/matches/fixtures/bouts/…

### MVP:
* The app should allow the user to create, edit and remove teams in the league
* The user should be able to create new games
* There should be a way to display all the games for a team and all the teams involved in a game
* The app should display if a game was won or lost

### Possible Extensions:
* Create a league table to see who is on top of the league
* Add players to teams and let them have game stats (points won, fouls, etc.)
* Anything else you can think of


## Dota 2 Esports League Table

The app will be based on the current season of the Dota 2 Esports League, which will generate tables for 'teams' and 'matches', users will be able to see fixtures for the teams and the W/L of each game. This will be a one-to-many relationship as each team can be in multiple matches but each match will can involve two teams.
